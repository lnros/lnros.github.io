# When a Tannic Barbera Crashes Your Night


I picked up a **2019 Santé Nizza DOCG** from *Produttori di Govone* after tasting a few good Barbera grape wines and stumbling upon its "high-end" Nizza form. I'm trying to shift my blog from home-brewing data scientist stuff to wine-loving data science, so this felt like a perfect bottle to kick things off.

## The Plan vs. Reality

1. **Opened the bottle two hours early.**  
2. Poured a tester sip. Still tight, kinda mute.  
3. Let it sit another hour (bottle open).  
4. Took a full glass. Boom: acid was bright, fruit was hiding, tannin was doing push-ups.

Thirty minutes later? The tannin sat down but wouldn't leave. Well, **it's a bummer I don't have another bottle like this to see how it develops**: life's hard that way.

## What I Learned (So You Don't Suffer)

- **Air time is not one-size-fits-all.** Two hours sounded safe, but this wine wanted marathon oxygen, not a sprint.
- **Bottle neck as decanter.** Surface area matters. If you don't own a decanter, a big mixing bowl or even a clean coffee press can fake it.
- **Food is your friend.** Rich plant fats (avocado, tahini) tame tannins just as well as aged cheese or a fatty steak: pick your lane.
- **Vintage matters.** 2019 in Piedmont gave Barbera more muscle than usual. Good for the cellar, tricky for my night.

## Quick Tips for Everyday Drinkers

1. **Open early, taste often.** Take a tiny sample right away; it sets a baseline.  
2. **Swirl like you mean it.** Oxygen levels spike with every swirl.  
3. **Mind the temp.** A jump from 16°C to 18-19°C will soften tannins faster than you think.  
4. **Keep a backup bottle.** Something juicy and lower-tannin (Dolcetto, Pinot Noir) saves the night if Plan A stays stubborn.

## Plant-Powered Tannin Tamers (and a Nod to the Cheese Crowd)

So, I'm vegetarian and lactose-intolerant: almost vegan, even if a tasty chocolate cake ambushes me. The good news? **Tannins love plant fats** just as much as dairy fats. Here's what worked for me:

- **Tahini or almond butter on toast**: creamy, nutty rescue squad.
- **Avocado drizzled with olive oil**: pure fat bomb that hugs harsh tannins.
- **Dark chocolate (70 %+ and dairy-free)**: Piemonte's Barbera meets Piemonte-style chocolate? Yes please.
- **Roasted walnuts or almonds**: oils + crunch = smoother sip.
- **Mushroom ragu over pasta**: earthy umami syncs with the wine's own forest vibes.

**For the cheese lovers out there:** A chunk of aged cheese will soften the same tannins, and a medium-rare steak never hurts: if that's your jam.

## Final Thoughts

Even "difficult" bottles teach us more than perfect ones. This Santé Nizza showed me patience, pairing, and the joy of experimentation. Next time I'll either decant four hours ahead or stash a second bottle for future comparison.

Until then, here's to learning one tannic sip at a time.
